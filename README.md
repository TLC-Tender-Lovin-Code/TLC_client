## Planning Story

We are team of big ideas. We knew we would have amazing ideas to work off of but who knew we have so many! In the beginning we had ideas for a trendy inventory management system for personal use and a social media site based on scrum protocol to help an organization run efficiently but we agreed to set up a social media site just for folks like us, we called it "The Dev Den". The Dev Den presented its challenges early on - before we even commited to code, we had to commit to a design and flow and of course user stories. As we continued you, we created our work flows and began to come together as a team to execute this space for developers to come together and build a community.
