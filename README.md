## The Dev Den: A virtual developer space

Welcome to "The Dev Den"! This is a space where developers can post code, project links and comment on each others posts. A users will have a personal den that includes a user Bio. Posts include short articles about the users topic of choice and other users will add comments to further the conversation. A user should also be able to edit their own content. The navbar allows the user to navigate and access all aspects of the site, as long as they have been authenticated. All authenticated users will have access to a view of all users. This is called the Watering Hole. Here you can click users name to view their den. When you access your own den, you will be able to update your password and profile. If for some reason you want to leave this robust community, you could also delete your profile.

## Planning Story

We are a team of big ideas. We knew we would have amazing ideas to work off of but who knew we'd have so many! In the beginning we had ideas for a trendy inventory management system for personal use and a social media site based on scrum protocol to help an organization run efficiently but we agreed to set up a social media site just for folks like us, we called it "The Dev Den". The Dev Den presented its challenges early on - before we even commited to code, we had to commit to a design and flow and, of course, user stories. As we continued , we created our work flows and began to come together as a team to execute this space for developers to come together and build a community.
